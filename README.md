## How to work on this

### Build tools

1.  Install parcel `$ sudo npm install -g parcel-bundler` If you run by any problem it's probably the node version, [parcel](https://parceljs.org/) doesn't work on old versions.

2.  run `npm run dev` on the root folder
3.  Go to `localhost:1234` to see the project

### SCSS

We are using a component/helper classes based CSS methodology. Once you have built the system, load the styleguide.html file so you can see the components in action.

### JS

Since we are using parcel, ES6 features do work.

### Deployment

Deployment will happen using gh-pages

run `npm run build` in the root folder.
